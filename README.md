## Objective
The aim of this project is to classify road and field images. To do so, I have trained a Convolutionnal Neural Network.

## Related code
The python notebook file relates all the work done from data preparation to label predictions. <br/>
If you want to visualize the results, open the notebook on github. <br/>
To train a new model or test my trained models on new images, you can either clone this repository and open the notebook on a IDE such as Jupyter Notebook or create a copy of my [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tIMJRKL8gZJKDMdfT38NaC3x7foxjd2f?usp=share_link) and run the notebook using Google Colab. <br/>
The model weights saved during all training tests are available on my [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tIMJRKL8gZJKDMdfT38NaC3x7foxjd2f?usp=share_link).
